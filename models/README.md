# IVERI AI Wake Word Models

Place your custom Porcupine wake word file here.

## Creating a custom "IVERI" wake word:

1. Go to https://console.picovoice.ai/ppn
2. Sign in with your Picovoice account
3. Click "Create Keyword"
4. Type "IVERI" as the keyword
5. Select "Raspberry Pi" as the target platform
6. Download the generated .ppn file
7. Rename it to: IVERI_en_raspberry-pi.ppn
8. Place it in this folder

The assistant will automatically use this wake word when it starts.

If no custom wake word is found, it will use "Alexa" as a fallback.
